This project was created to simulate an industrial process. The wooden robotic arm, controlled by a tablet via bluetooth, can manipulate small piece from a place to another one. The arm has 4 degrees of freedom, where each one is controlled by a servor motor. To supply the necessary current demanded by the servor motors, an external battery was used. The following are the components which where used to build this project:

    1) Arduino UNO
    2) 1 wooden robotic arm (The pieces can be bought and assembled)
    3) 4 servo motors 9g
    4) One Bluetooth module
    5) One 5v external battery
    6) 1 Breadboard
    7) Jumpers

The angles adopted in this project, depending on how it was assembled, may vary from arm to arm.
It's necessary to test the range of each servo to set the minimum and maximum angles. Otherwise
the arm can be harmed.
